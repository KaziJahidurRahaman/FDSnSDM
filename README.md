# FDSnSDM
The repository contains my task for the academic course **'Forestry data structures and spatial data models'** of FIT program at **HNEE** assigned by Dr. Evelyn Wallor

## Objective
The objective of this work is to conceptually design a soil measurement database which serves to provide easy access to specific types of data as the provided sample. The work also aims to construct the database in such that the consistency and integrity of the data is preserved during the update or deletion of existing data. Finally, it also expects to report on the performance on the developed database.

## Conclusion
The goal of this work was to develop a sophisticated database structure which can not only accommodate a large number of soil measurements data, but also ensure that the data can be easily accessed for using in less amount of time while also keeping the consistency of data. The proposed database design has easily been explained in this report. The normalization concept applied in the design to ensure less redundancy as well as less time complexity. The application of several key concepts also contributes to lessening the complexity also ensures the database is automatically updated while updating or deleting an existing data.  Although the efficiency of the design is discussed, there is still aspects where improvement can be made with more background knowledge of soil science.
